            Jaipur, Rajasthan
Rajasthan’s desert capital is affectionately known as the “Pink City” due to the pink walls of its fortresses and palaces, though that wasn’t always the case. In preparation for the visit of Prince Albert and Queen Victoria in 1876, Maharaja Ram Singh of Jaipur painted the entire city pink—the color representing hospitality—in preparation. Residents continue the tradition. One cannot pass through without paying a visit to the 16th-century hilltop Amber Fort, the City Palace, or the red sandstone Hawa Mahal—also known as the Palace of the Winds—whose window-filled high wall allowed royal females to watch the street below unseen.
